# gulp_watch_copy
 The goal of this project is maintain the same directory structore for both development and production side.
 
 If you use Angular 2 quickstart as starter then you must have seen that all your ts,js,map.js and html files are staying at the same place in your app directory. At the very begining it's okay but as your project grow over time you will find your directory is full with typescript generated files. 
 
 
This workflow will help keep your development directory neat and clean.
